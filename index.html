    <div id="about">
      <p class="about">
        As a dynamic educator transitioning into software engineering, I bring a unique blend of problem-solving skills, a passion for technology, and a proven ability to overcome challenges. My journey into tech is fueled by hands-on experience in building computers, scripting, and a year-long, intensive software engineering boot camp at Flatiron School, where I honed my skills in Python and full-stack development. I am eager to leverage my background in teaching, combined with my technical expertise, to contribute to innovative and impactful software projects.

      <p class="about">
        From a young age, I dedicated myself to the rigorous demands of competitive swimming, eventually earning a place on the Texas A&M Swimming & Diving team. This experience instilled in me the values of teamwork, commitment, time management, endurance, and mental toughnessâ€”qualities that have guided me throughout my life. Seeking new challenges, I later trained for and completed an Ironman triathlon, a testament to my perseverance and dedication. Despite the race being delayed three times due to COVID-19, I remained committed to my training and achieved my goal, further solidifying my ability to overcome obstacles and achieve long-term objectives.
      </p>
      <p class="about">
        Throughout my professional career, I have consistently sought ways to automate and streamline tasks, leading me to self-teach Python. This initial foray into programming sparked a passion for software development, ultimately motivating me to pursue a career change. My journey, marked by setting and achieving ambitious goals, has prepared me to tackle the challenges of software engineering with the same determination and resilience that has defined my previous successes. I am ready to contribute, grow, and succeed in this exciting new field.
